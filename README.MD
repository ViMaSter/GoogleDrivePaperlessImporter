# paperless Google Drive importer

Script that attempts to import all files inside a [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) folder to a [paperless-ng instance](https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng).

# Setup
1. Download binary or compile source
2. Create a `config.json` in the working directory of your app containing the following:
```
{
  "paperless": {
    "absoluteInstanceURL": "", // absolute root URL of your paperless instance
    "username": "", // username of a user with upload capabilities
    "password": "" // password of a user with upload capabilities
  },
  "googleDrive": {
    "credentials": ... // replace "..." with the contents of a `.json` credential-file generated by Google for a "Desktop Application" Google API Project client with "drive.file"-scope
  },
  "processor": {
    "pauseAfterCompletedListInMinutes": 2 // decimal values are supported for smaller ranges
  }
}
```
3. Run executable

**Note:** Any failure will result in the app stopping; ensure a watchdog is present to restart this app and/or forward any logs/exceptions
